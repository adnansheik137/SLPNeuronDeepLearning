# SLPNeuronDeepLearning
This GitHub repository is dedicated to the exploration and experimentation with the Perceptron model and its learning algorithm. The Perceptron, a pioneering concept in neurocomputing, serves as the foundation for supervised binary classification.
Key Focus:

Binary Classification: The Perceptron is a binary classifier, making decisions on whether an input vector belongs to a specific class. It employs a linear predictor function that combines weights with feature vectors.
Customization and Hyperparameters:

Learning Rates: We investigate the influence of different learning rates on model training. The learning rate is a critical hyperparameter that determines the step size during updates, impacting convergence speed and final performance.

Initial Bias Values: We explore the effects of varying initial bias values on model behavior. Bias plays a crucial role in shifting decision boundaries and influencing model initialization.
